# Module 02A - Register & Scan (ADLS Gen2)

##  Introduction

To populate Microsoft Purview with assets for data discovery and understanding, you must register sources that exist across our data estate so that we can leverage the out of the box scanning capabilities. Scanning enables Microsoft Purview to extract technical metadata such as the fully qualified name, schema, data types, and apply classifications by parsing a sample of the underlying data.

In this module, you'll walk through how to register and scan data sources. You'll create a new collection for your first data source, upload data and configure scanning. By the end of this module you'll have technical metadata, such as schema information, stored in Purview. You can use this to start linking to business terms, allowing your team members to easier find data

##  Objectives

* Create a collection.
* Register and scan an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account using the Microsoft Purview managed identity.

## 1. Grant the Microsoft Purview Managed Identity Access

> **Did you know?**
>
> To scan a source, Microsoft Purview requires a set of **credentials**. For Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Microsoft Purview supports the following [authentication methods](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/purview/register-scan-adls-gen2#setting-up-authentication-for-a-scan).
>
> * Managed Identity (recommended)
>* Service Principal
> * Account Key
> 
> In this module we will walk through how to grant the Microsoft Purview Managed Identity the necessary access to successfully configure and run a scan.

1. Navigate to the **purviewlab-rg** resource group, and select `pvlab{randomId}adls` storage account.

2. Select **Access Control (IAM) (1)** from the left navigation menu and click **Add role assignments (2)**.

    ![Microsoft Purview](../images/module02/m2ex1stp2.1.png)

3. Filter the list of roles by searching for **Storage Blob Data Reader (1)**, click the row to select the role, and then click **Next (2)**.

## 3. Create a Collection

> **Did you know?**
>
> [Collections](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/how-to-create-and-manage-collections) in Microsoft Purview can be used to organize data sources, scans, and assets in a hierarchical model based on how your organization plans to use Microsoft Purview. The collection hierarchy also forms the security boundary for your metadata to ensure users don't have access to data they don't need (e.g. sensitive metadata). 
>
> For more information, check out [Collection Architectures and Best Practices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/concept-best-practices-collections).

1. Navigate back to the browser tab in which Purview Studio is open. From the Purview Studio, navigate to **Data Map** > **Collections**, and click  **Add a collection**.

    ![New Collection](../images/module02/lab2-purview01.png)

2. Provide the below value for the collection name and click on **Create**.

   ```
   Contoso
   ```
   
    ![New Collection](../images/module02/02.76-collection-create.png)

## 4. Register a Source (ADLS Gen2)

1. From the Purview Studio, navigate to **Data Map** > **Sources**, and click on **Register**.

    ![Register](../images/module02/lab2-purview02.png)

2. On the **Register Sources** blade, scroll down and select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** and click **Continue**.

    ![Sources](../images/module02/m2a-t4-step2.png)

3. Now, on the **Register sources (Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2)** blade, enter the following information:
    - **Azure subscription**: Select your subscription from the dropdown.
    - **Storage account name**: Select **pvlab{randomId}adls** from the dropdown.
    - **Select a collection**: Select **pvlab-randomId}-pv > Contoso** from the dropdown.
    -  Leave other values as default and click on **Register**.

    > **Did you know?**
    >
    > At this point, we have simply registered a data source. Assets are not written to the catalog until after a scan has finished running.

## 5. Scan a Source with the Microsoft Purview Managed Identity

1. From the Purview Studio, navigate to **Data Map** > **Sources**, and within the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 tile, click the **New Scan** button.

    ![New Scan](../images/module02/lab2-purview03.png)

    > **Did you know?**
    >
    > [Scan Rule Sets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/purview/create-a-scan-rule-set) determine which **File Types** and **Classification Rules** are in scope. If you want to include a custom file type or custom classification rule as part of a scan, a custom scan rule set will need to be created.

    ![Scan rule set](../images/module02/m2a-t5-step4.png)

5. Select **Once** and click **Continue**.

    ![Scan Trigger](../images/module02/m2a-t5-step5.png)
